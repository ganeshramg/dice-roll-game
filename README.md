# dice-roll-game
I created this game as a milestone in learning front end developemt using HTML 5, CSS, and Javascript

## How to run it
1. Clone the repo
2. CD to the folder
3. Copy path of index.html and paste it and go on the browser, or just open the index.html using a browser

## Play
1. Click the button 'ROLL' to roll the dice
2. The dice with the greater number wins
3. Left side is Player 1 and right side is Player 2
4. If the numbers are equal, it's a draw
5. Click 'RESET' button to reset

# Technical
## Function is index.js

1. getRandom - this will fetch a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive
2. roll - this will fetch two random numbers, assign it to variables, compares, and changes the contents like image of the dice, and who won the game
